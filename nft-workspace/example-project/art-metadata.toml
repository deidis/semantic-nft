# After we processed the global tags, we will clear all other semantic tags that we support
# However the user can clear additional tags if needed. For example:
Software = ""

# Same as clearing we can add additional tags from other vocabularies if necessary.
# For example, we use XMP-xmpRights to specify various aspects of licensing:
"XMP-xmpRights:Owner" = "Name Surname, Name2 Surname2"

# Always prescribe a license!
license='licensing/CC0.txt'
# If the certificate isn't provicded for an artwork, don't generate the default one
certificate=''

# We can also refer to the file name relative to the this .toml file
["landscape.jpg"]
# XMP-dc:Title and exif:ImageDescription
title = "Title of the landscape photo"
# If relative path is given, we'll try to generate it into landscape/certificate.pdf
certificate="certificate.pdf"
license='licensing/CC BY.txt'

# We can dictate what format will the preview be generated, and what metadata it should have (overriding form the artwork)
["landscape/preview.webp"]
title = "Preview for the landscape photo"

# We can also refer to the working folder relative to this .toml file
["../example-project/portrait"]
title = "Name of the portrait photo"
# Though we set the XMP-dc:Title as to the same as exif:ImageDescription, we can still overwrite it
"Exif:ImageDescription" = "Short description of the portrait photo"
# It's the long notation of the path, equivalent to specifying "certificate.pdf" only
certificate="portrait/certificate.pdf"

# When the artwork doesn't have special characters in the name, we can even ommit the quotes,
# in this case it will pick-up the file ./square/artwork.jpg
[square]
title = "Name of the square photo"
# This path is outside of the working folder context, so it will not be taken into generation, but will be kept as is
certificate={"../square-certificate.pdf" = {Author = 'Name Surname', creator = 'Creator Name'}}

# As there's no file in the current dir, this table will be kept as is
